# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The Express project is a backend server intended to support the WTWR Front-end React project. I worked with databases, set up security, testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The goal was to create a server with an API and user authorization.
It currently supports routes for the users and items endpoints, which correspond to 2 databases: one database stores the users, and another database stores clothing items.

## Project features

Node.js
Express framework
MongoDB databases
Modular design and routing
Custom error class

Request authorization
